Problem: Two Sum
Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Solution:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevHash = {}

        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            difference = target - num
            if difference in prevHash:
                return [prevHash[difference], index]
            prevHash[num] = index
